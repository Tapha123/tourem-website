excerpt: The 13-MD is a new generic instrument developed to measure general health-related quality of life (GHRQoL). This instrument considers all aspects of health (i.e., physical, mental, and social) in a balanced way. A previous study led to minor changes in the original version of the 13-MD. The objective of this study was to confirm the validity of the modified 13-MD.
