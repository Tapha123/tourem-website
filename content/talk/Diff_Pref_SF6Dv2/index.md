excerpt: A considerable debate persists in the literature about whose preferences should be considered in the calculation of quality-adjusted life-years. Some suggest considering only the preferences of the general population, while others advocate for the consideration of those of patients or a combination of both. This study aims to inform and measure the differences in health preferences between cancer patients and the general population in Quebec.
