I had the immense pleasure to be part of the 2024/2025 cohort of the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/cand3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Consortium on Analytics for Data-Driven Decision-Making (CAnD3)</a> where I had the opportunity to enhance my skills regarding data analysis as well as expanding my network by meeting great researchers from many domains.

I had the chance to discover a myriad of tools for data analysis, among them are the Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). I could experiment creating one as showed below:


<a href="#fig:DAG_MT"></a>
<div class="figure">
<img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/DAG_MT.png" alt="A Nice DAG." width="672" />
<p class="caption"><span id="fig:pie"></span>Figure 1: A Nice DAG.</p>
</div>
