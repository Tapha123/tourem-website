I had the immense pleasure to be part of the 2024/2025 cohort of the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/cand3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Consortium on Analytics for Data-Driven Decision-Making (CAnD3)</a> where I had the opportunity to enhance my skills regarding data analysis as well as expanding my network by meeting great researchers from many domains.

My goals in joining the CAnD3 cohort were to expand my skills in data management and analysis, in communication and to meet with professionals from diverse fields. To date, I am beyond satisfied on how I am progressing toward reaching these goals. This program is a gem!

I had the chance to discover a myriad of tools for data analysis and among them are the Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). I could experiment creating one as showed below:
