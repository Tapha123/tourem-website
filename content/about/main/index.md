  After earning a PhD in Development Economics with honors from <a href="https://www.usherbrooke.ca/admission/programme/734/doctorat-en-economie-du-developpement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Université de Sherbrooke</a>, I now serve as a postdoctoral fellow at McGill University’s Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Occupational Health. As a researcher, I am interested in leveraging data to inform strategies and policies. My work spans the fields of economics, health economics, public health, public policy, and social inequalities, emphasizing how economic frameworks influence societal outcomes and drive impactful solutions.
  
  Curiosity and dedication have defined my journey, driving me to transform complex information into actionable solutions that make a meaningful impact.

  When I’m not *"economizing"*, I enjoy immersing myself in sports, whether it’s playing basketball, cheering for football (soccer) matches, or capturing the world through my camera lens. Sports and photography are my go-to ways to relax and find inspiration beyond the numbers.
