  From a young age, I’ve been captivated by the ability of numbers to solve complex problems and uncover meaningful insights. This passion led me to pursue a career in economics, where data and analysis intersect to address critical societal challenges.
  
  After earning a PhD in Development Economics with honors from <a href="https://www.usherbrooke.ca/admission/programme/734/doctorat-en-economie-du-developpement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Université de Sherbrooke</a>, I now serve as a postdoctoral fellow at McGill University’s Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Occupational Health. As a researcher, I am interested in leveraging data to inform strategies and policies. My work spans the fields of economics, health economics, public health, public policy, and social inequalities, emphasizing how economic frameworks influence societal outcomes and drive impactful solutions.
  
  Curiosity and dedication have defined my journey, driving me to transform complex information into actionable solutions that make a meaningful impact.

  When I’m not diving into data and research, you’ll probably find me passionately analyzing a different kind of statistic—game scores! Whether it’s shooting hoops on the basketball court or cheering on my favorite football (soccer) teams, sports are my ultimate way to unwind.
